1)Explain the boot process of linux ?
A)BIOS POST
  Boot loader (GRUB2)
  Kernel initialization
  Start systemd, the parent of all processes.
  1)When power is first applied to the computer it runs the POST (Power On Self Test) which is part of the BIOS (Basic I/O System).
  2)GRUB2 stands for "GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2" and it is now the primary bootloader for most current Linux distributions. 
  GRUB2 is the program which makes the computer just smart enough to find the operating system kernel and load it into memory.
  3)All of the kernels are in a self-extracting, compressed format to save space. The kernels are located in the /boot directory, 
    along with an initial RAM disk image, and device maps of the hard drives.After the selected kernel is loaded into memory and begins executing
  Once the kernel has extracted itself, it loads systemd, which is the replacement for the old SysV init program, and turns control over to it.
  4)systemd is the mother of all processes and it is responsible for bringing the Linux host up to a state in which productive work can be done.
